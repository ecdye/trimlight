An initial attempt to capture with trimproxy. Was able to see trimproxy in the app.

* App seemed to correctly show `timer` v. `manual` state of the controller.
* Attempting to enter controller while in `timer` state gave the expected error.
* Attempting to enter controller while in `manual` state gave a `SYNC ERROR` in the app.
